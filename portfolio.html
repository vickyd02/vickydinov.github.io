        This is my scratch project. It is an interactive love story between a human woman and a male centaur.

        They go on a hike together and then they go to a concert.
      </p>
      <p>
        They interact with the user and allow them to make decisions on where the couple will go next.
        In the end, the couple gets together and rides away into the sunset.</p>

      <p> This is our Python Project. It is an interactive game where the user is a sloth running away from a jaguar.
        The user has to make a series of decisions in order to avoid being eaten by the jaguar. Along the way, 
        the sloth meets another injured sloth and that is the turning point of the story because the user has to make the decision 
        of whether to help the sloth or not. If the user doesn't help the sloth, then he dies, but if he helps, then he survives the day and continues on with the game.<br>

       This is my Canopy Project, coded in Python. This project is a battleship game in which the user
       can choose random locations on our grid in an attempt to locate our hidden battleship.
      The user gets fifteen tries, after which the game finishes if they do not locate our battleship.
