      <p style= "font-family:verdana;"This is my scratch project. It is an interactive love story between a human woman and a male centaur. 
      They go on a hike together and then they go to a concert. 
      They interact with the user and allow them to make decisions on where the couple will go next. 
      In the end, the couple gets together and rides away into the sunset.>
